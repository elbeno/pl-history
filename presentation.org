* The Book I've Been Reading

Programming Languages: History and Fundamentals, by Jean Sammet

[[./book.jpg]]

published in 1969

#+begin_notes
Jean Sammet had a bachelor's and a master's degree in mathematics, and an
honorary doctorate from her bachelor's alma mater.

She developed the FORMAC language and was one of the developers of COBOL.

Beyond that, in the words of Walter Brown, this book was "her life's work".

 - About 120 languages
 - Over 800 bibliographic references
 - Examples for major languages

An astonishing reference work and a useful insight into how many things we think
are new concerns, new ideas, new aspects of the programmer's condition were in
fact well-known by the late 60s.
#+end_notes

* Definitions

Jean begins with the definition of a programming language.

 - Machine code knowledge is unnecessary
 - Potential for conversion to other computers
 - Problem-oriented notation

#+REVEAL_HTML: <blockquote nil><p>&quot;The first characteristic of a programming language is that the user can write a program without knowing much -- if anything -- about the physical characteristics of the machine on which the program is to be run. This same comment does not apply if he [sic] wishes to obtain maximum efficiency.&quot;</p></blockquote>

#+begin_notes
The programming community needed definitions: machine code vs assembly vs
programming languages.

This stuff was quite new at the time.

And yet the concerns are familiar: the ability to fit the language to its
problem domain, portability desires, and the abstraction afforded by the
language distinct from the hardware.
#+end_notes

* Advantages and disadvantages

She then contrasts high-level language advantages and disadvantages.

#+begin_notes
"Low-level" here might be literal machine code.

Compilation time was a big concern. In fact even more of a concern than it is
today. No matter how long the compilation time is today, we can be pretty sure
that the runtime will outweigh it. This was not the case then!
n
Debugging is in both columns: high level languages are easier to debug in
general, but when you have to go under the hood, they can obfuscate things.

Completeness was a concern: can the language express everything you need it to?
This was the era where special-purpose languages outnumbered general-purpose languages.
#+end_notes

* On professional programmers

(distinct perhaps from scientists who use\\
programming to solve their non-programming domain problems)

#+REVEAL_HTML: <blockquote nil><p>&quot;In the case of a language designed for use by a professional programmer, a major characteristic is to provide maximum capability.&quot;</p></blockquote>

#+REVEAL_HTML: <blockquote nil><p>&quot;...the professional programmer will almost always want to be able to get at the machine code.&quot;</p></blockquote>

#+begin_notes
Abstractions often need to be truly zero cost to satisfy the professional programmer.

And we always want proof. Now we have tools like Compiler Explorer that help us out.

Trust but verify is our creed. We need to know that the machine code is correct and efficient.
#+end_notes

* On standardization and language definitions

#+REVEAL_HTML: <blockquote nil><p>&quot;...it should be kept in mind that the language and the means of defining the language are not the same thing.&quot;</p></blockquote>

#+REVEAL_HTML: <blockquote nil><p>&quot;Somehow the standardization process must avoid eliminating or preventing technical progress. This is extremely difficult...&quot;</p></blockquote>

#+begin_notes
We live this in C++.

We don't produce one implementation: we produce a specification. This is one of
the things that makes standardization so difficult.

And of course the tension between standardization and technical progress is
something we still struggle with. We probably always will.
#+end_notes

* On judging languages

#+REVEAL_HTML: <blockquote nil><p>&quot;The usefulness of the language must be judged independently of the compilers which implement it.&quot;</p></blockquote>

#+REVEAL_HTML: <blockquote nil><p>&quot;The two greatest criticisms of compilers are slow compilation and poor object code.&quot;</p></blockquote>

#+REVEAL_HTML: <blockquote nil><p>&quot;Only after a language has been in use for a while can its advantages be ascertained.&quot;</p></blockquote>

#+begin_notes
These are good things to remember as we head into C++20. It will take time to
see which features are great, which need more attention, and which we were wrong
about.
#+end_notes

* A final thought
In the end, /plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose/.

#+REVEAL_HTML: <blockquote nil><p>&quot;...the complexities of today's large computers make it very difficult to learn to program them at all, let alone effectively.&quot;</p></blockquote>
